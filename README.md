Final Project for DATA 2401

# Project Motivation
Algorithms are embedded into nearly every facet of our lives. Predictive algorithms function as tools for optimizing business performance and streamlining our day to day actions. Albeit some data must be used as reference in order to generate accurate predictions. Historical data come bundled with biases and are typically unrepresentative of current day society. Today institutions use predictive algorithms trained on historic data, to streamline their business functions. The rising field of algorithmic fairness is attempting to address and mitigate disproportionate harms from recorded historical biases in data.

Here is an example of this practice today:

-   Today banks currently predict creditworthiness from sensitive attributes in tandem with their financial history. This prediction process is relevant as women were not allowed to open their own bank accounts with protection from credit discrimination until 1974. Historically, bank account records will be practically all owned or operated by males before then.

## Dataset Background:

Similar to predictive banking and hiring: Predictive policing uses historical data and algorithms to identify potential criminal history. Adoption of these methods and recent police conduct prompt this analysis.
